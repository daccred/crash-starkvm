# Crash
Crash is a scratch-based blockchain education system, powered by Google blockly & inspired by the MIT Scratch Project


## About the VM Execution Environment

This VM / Execution Environment powers the blockchain runtime layer for `crash`. Our goal is to implement a Rust based contract compiler and rules preprocessors that accepts `blockly`  JSON parameters defined on the Crash GUI as arguments to generate and compile smart contracts that can be executed directly on the crash learning platform.
